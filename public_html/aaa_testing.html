        <h4>Why is testing important?</h4>
    </div>

        <h2>Understanding AAA Testing</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>AAA testing is an acronym for <strong><i>Arrange, Act, Assert</i></strong>. These are the steps to develop an effective
            unit test for your code.<br><br>
            <b>Arrange - </b> involves the construction of the test case. This is where you set up the situation and
            parameters needed to test a function or method.<br><br>
            <b>Act - </b> is executing the target behavior of the test case. Utilizing the arrangement from the previous
            step, <i>Act</i> involves performing the action that is being tested.<br><br>
            <b>Assert </b>- is the act of confirming expected outcomes. This step takes the result from the <i>Act</i> step
             and tests it against the expected outcome</p>
            <hr>
            <h4>Why AAA is Important?!</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Arrange-Act-Assert is powerful because it is simple. It forces tests to focus on independent, individual
                behaviors. It separates setup actions from the main actions. It requires test to make verifications and
                not merely run through motions. Notice how the pattern is not Arrange-Act-Assert-Act-Assert â€“ subsequent
                actions and assertions belong in separate tests. Arrange-Act-Assert is a great pattern to follow for
                writing good functional tests.
            </p>

            <h4> How AAA Testing is implemented in Calculator?? </h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                The addition function adds a tuple of numbers and stores it to the history. This is the <i>facade</i> of
            the calculator so the actual calculation, the object creation, and storing the value in the history is hidden
            behind the scenes. But regardless, this function is supposed to return the sum of the values. Below shown
            code is the AAA style unit test for the addition function.
            </p>
            <img class="article_img" src="images/AAA_addition_calc.png" alt="pylint passed" width="550" height="150"><br>
            <br>
            <p>
                The first line where the tuple is created will be the <i>Arrange</i> step where data is set up to
             perform the test.
             The second step is <i>Act</i> where the main action is performed. The addition function is called and the
             <i>result</i> variable is set to the result of the method.
            In the last step, the <i>Assertion</i> is made where we know the expected result,
            and we are making sure that the method returns the expected result. In this case, 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.
            </p>
            <img class="article_img" src="images/AAA_division_calc.png" alt="pylint passed" width="550" height="150"><br>
            <br>
            <p>The division function divides a tuple of numbers and stores in to the history.
            The first line where the tuple is created will be the <i>Arrange</i> step where data is set up to perform
            the test.
            The second step is <i>Act</i> where the main action is performed. The division  function is called and the
            <i>result</i> variable is set to the result of the method.
            In the last step, the <i>Assertion</i> is made where we know the expected result and making sure that the method
            returns the expected result.

            <h4>Testing Using external Data</h4>
            <br>
            <p>An important aspect to testing would be making sure that the code is able to handle large amounts of data
            In this example, we use pandas to read csv files containing data that will test each of the operations.

            </p>
            <p>An important aspect to testing your code is making sure that it is suitable to handle copious amounts of data
            when it scales up. In this example, we use pandas to supply csv files containing data that will test each of
            the operations. To demonstrate how to accomplish this, I will be using the <i>pandas</i> python package, and
            demonstrate how to test with CSV's using the "test_subtracting method".</p>
            <hr>
            <p>We need to set up our csv files. Below, The CSV file used to create 4 columns containing
            three different values, and a result column containing the addition of the values. Once we have the CSV,
            we can put it into our project folder.
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Once, the CSV is prepared. we can start writing the data using the pandas dataframe. Here, the class "CsvRead"
            which reads the csv files and takes filepath as an input. The pandas modules has a method called "read_csv"
            which makes it easy.
            </p>

            <br><br>
            <p>Below, we're testing this method and making sure that it prints out the data frame we expected. For this,
            we want to assure that we can access the values within the dataframe, so we print out the 'value_A' item from
            each row.
