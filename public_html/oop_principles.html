    <h2>Principles of OOP</h2>
    <div class="article_content">
    <hr>
    <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
    <p>Encapsulation is the concept that an object contains its own, private information. Within a class that is
       built around an object, the class contains public methods that are able to operate on the private information
       held within the objects private variables. The private information for an object is unique to that object,
       and even objects within the same class cannot directly access that information.
       In the calculator, we have implemented this concept with our Calculation class.</p>

       <img class="article_img" src="images/Encapsulation.png" alt="An image of the calculation class in the calculator" width="500" height="150">
       <br>
       <br>
       <p> The calculation class initiates/creates an object with the private variable "values" which is instantiated by the user.
           Although there are a few more steps within the program to create an object, this represents encapsulation
           because the "values" is stored within "self" which is the object.</p>
       <hr>
       <h3>Abstraction</h3>
       <p>Abstraction is the concept that extends from encapsulation. An object should only be operable at a high level
       by the class it was created with. Within programming in general, there is a goal to achieve, and it does not
       matter how that goal is achieved. Within the calculator program, I will show you how abstraction works with the addition method.</p>

       <img class="article_img" src="images/Abstraction.png" alt="addition method of the calculator" width="500" height="200">
        <br>
       <p>From the Calculator class, passing a tuple the "adding" method will return the sum of the numbers
         passed to it. However, we can see that the calculator is more involved than just summing the values. There
         is a History class, and a method, "addition_calculation" that is not found inside the calculator. So let's
         follow this program and see where we end up.</p>
        <img class="article_img" src="images/Abstraction1.png" alt="addition_calculation method in history class" height="200" width="500">
        <br>
        <p>When we follow the trail to the addition calculation of the History class, we can see that there is a method,
           "append_to_history", that adds the Addition.create(values) to a history. This is representative of the factory method,
           where each method has one task and that's it. The task of "append_to_history" is to store the object to a history
           that can be referenced later one, however, right now, we are concerned with where the addition calculation occurs.
           Next, we will follow this method to the Addition class.</p>
        <img class="article_img" src="images/Abstraction2.png" alt="image of the addition class" width="500" height="200">
        <br>
        <p>Finally, we have reached the end. We can see that this object reaches its result by calling
           a methods through a series of classes, and eventually leads back to the Addition class to perform the summing
           operation. Then the result is returned through those same methods and the user can receive the result at the surface.
           </p>

        <h3>Inheritance</h3>
        <p>Inheritance within object-oriented programming is similar to how inheritance works within real life. Similar to
           how a child inherits the traits of the parents, a child class can inherit traits from a parent class within
           object-oriented programming! This allows a developer to reduce redundancy and allow a generic parent class
           share its methods and traits with multiple, more specific child classes. In our calculator, we can see this
           in the Calculation class and how it interacts with the children classes.</p>
        <br>
        <img class="article_img" src="images/Inheritance.png" alt="calculation class" height="375" width="500">
        <br><br>
        <p>Above, we can see the entire calculation class for the calculator. On its own, it doesn't particularly do
           too much. It instantiates an object, it has a factory method to create objects, and it converts a tuple of
           values into a list of floats. That is not particularly exciting, but it serves a very important function. It
           essentially prepares the values passed to it to be used by its children classes. Addition, Subtraction,
           Multiplication, and Division.
